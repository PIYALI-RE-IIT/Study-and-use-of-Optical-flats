1.	Clean the optical flat from any dirt and defects
2.	Place the optical bench on the stable surface
3.	Position the monochromatic light and switch it on.
4.	Place the test surface on an optical bench.
5.	Place the optical flat on the test surface with the reference surface facing down
6.	Direct the monochromatic light on the optical flat and observe the interference pattern (fringes).
7.	Analyse the interference fringes by observing the pattern of alternative dark and bright fringes.
8.	Based on the orientation of these fringes, information about the deviations in flatness across the test surface is obtained.
9.	Calculate the no. of fringes and find the value of Î”H between master gauge and sample gauge
10.	Discard the sample gauge whose tolerance is out of the tolerance limit.
